# C# Tutorial Create a simple picture matching game in windows form and .Net

Hi, in this tutorial we will make a picture matching game. in this game you will match 2 pictures by clicking on the empty picture boxes. The game will load the pictures in random positions in the Grid and when one of them is clicked it will reveal the hidden picture. If two pictures are matched then it will keep both of them on the display. The game will continue until all 6 pictures are matched or if the timer goes to 0. You can restart the game and it will randomize the pictures again in the game so the game is always dynamically changing the locations of the pictures. We will be using picture box tags in the windows form framework to randomly position them across the grid.
